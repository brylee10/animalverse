# Animalverse: Bring nature to your browser 🐅 🐟🐦
Let some members of the animal kingdom pay you a visit in Chrome.

Configure animals from run, fly, or crawl (?) in the browser. Install for yourself to get a nice laugh or remind yourself to reset and look outside. Install for a friend to make them confused why there are ants crawling across their screen. 

Configurable to only run at particular intervals or dates, like April fools...

## Demos
